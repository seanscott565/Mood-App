# Mood-App
A simple mood app thats still in development, takes weather and time from Jacksonville Florida and bases it on what mood you pick

This is in early beta and probobly will not be finshed. This is just a side project and using it to learn HTML and JS. 

All the code is all over the place because its just me learning lol. And also learning github too.
